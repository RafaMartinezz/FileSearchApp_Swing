# File search application

This project provides a simple Java Swing application that allows users to search for text patterns within files. Users can open a `.txt` file, specify a search pattern, and view the matching results highlighted within the content of the file. This project is suitable for learning about Java Swing, text file handling, and regex-based pattern matching.

## Features

- **Open and Read Files**: Users can select and display the contents of a `.txt` file.
- **Pattern Search**: Users can specify a regex search pattern to find and highlight within the file's text.
- **Pattern Highlighting**: Matches are highlighted in the text area for easy visual identification.

## Project Structure

- **Formulario.java**: Contains the main application logic and GUI components, such as buttons, text areas, and labels.
- **Formulario.form**: Defines the layout of the GUI in XML format, as generated by NetBeans. This file specifies the positions and properties of GUI components.
- **Dependencies**: No external libraries are required; the application uses core Java Swing and AWT packages.

## Files

- `Formulario.java`: Main class containing the JFrame, button actions, and search functionality.
- `Formulario.form`: GUI layout in XML format, used by NetBeans to render the JFrame design visually.

## Usage

1. **Select a File**: 
   - Click the **Examinar** button to open a file chooser and select a `.txt` file. The file’s content will be displayed in the main text area.

2. **Enter a Search Pattern**:
   - Type a regex pattern in the search field labeled **Patrón de búsqueda**.

3. **Perform the Search**:
   - Click **Buscar** to highlight matches within the file’s text content.

## GUI Components

- **Examinar**: Opens a file chooser dialog to select a `.txt` file.
- **Buscar**: Finds and highlights occurrences of the specified pattern in the text area.
- **Salida**: A text area where the contents of the selected file are displayed and highlighted as per search results.

## Code Highlights

- **Pattern Matching**: The application uses regular expressions to find and highlight patterns within a file’s text.
- **Text Highlighting**: Implemented using Java Swing's `Highlighter` class, highlighting matched patterns with a distinct color.
- **Error Handling**: Prompts and validations ensure that users enter valid input and select text files.
